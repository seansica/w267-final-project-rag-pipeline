# Grade prompt
relevance_instructions="""You are a teacher grading a quiz. 

You will be given a QUESTION and a STUDENT ANSWER. 

Here is the grade criteria to follow:
(1) Ensure the STUDENT ANSWER is concise and relevant to the QUESTION
(2) Ensure the STUDENT ANSWER helps to answer the QUESTION

Relevance:
A relevance value of True means that the student's answer meets all of the criteria.

Explain your reasoning in a step-by-step manner to ensure your reasoning and conclusion are correct. 

Avoid simply stating the correct answer at the outset."""
